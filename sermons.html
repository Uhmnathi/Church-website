                <div class="post">
                    <p class="content">
                The book of Proverbs teaches us to hear the instructions of the father, and not to forsake the law of the mother.
                      When we do so we are able to resist the invitation of sinners ,and/or peer-pressure influences on us. We will not concede to going with the crowds when they participate in ungodly acts .
                    Sinners tend to do evil in order to gain possessions and wealth , they do not mind spilling blood to achieve their goals.
                    They are greedy and selfish and they are not aware that by doing so they are digging their own graves,and shorten their
                     own lives, as their own greed  kills them. We are warned not to use the same way they use to walk, 
                    and we should completely refrain from putting our feet on their paths.
                   The best to do is to listen to the voice  of Wisdom ! She always calls loudly from public places , i.e.city gates, open spaces and market places ,
                    where transactions take place . She guides us but we do not listen ! She is always asking , until when are we going to be foolish ? Why are we not 
                  listening to her call of protecting the city called ‚ÄúME‚Äù!(the city ME being you individually )
                   The city ME, hosts your heart which is the fountain of your life. Wisdom dictates that you protect the gates that let in things  go into your heart , that will make you take foolish decisions .
                    Those gates are the eyes, the ears and the mouth. When you hear things chose  what you want to take in ,also select what is good from things you see, and speak no evil with your mouth . If by seeing and hearing you chose evil counsel ,
                     it will come out of your mouth , and you will be seen as foolish .
                   Never despise the knowledge and the call of Wisdom .  Wisdom is always waiting to  hold your hand and pulls you out of difficult situations . 
                   If you undermine her,  when you get into trouble , she will laugh at you , she will not respond and will not be found.
                   Choose wisdom , which is the fear of the Lord at all times , do not  be complacent , and you will live, you will dwell in with the Lord and be safe. If you reject Wisdom , you will die!üò¢.
                   SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY : 
                   Proverbs 1:1-33;
                   Hebrews 12: 3-4; 
                   Proverbs 4:22-24.
                   Siyabonga Mfundisi  L Makgatho for such a powerful and inspiring lesson ! God has put you on our paths for teachings as these ! May He continuously bless you !

                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uafcmamelodiriverside" class="sermon-title">GOD ALWAYS USES A MAN TO REACH A NATION.</a>

                <div class="post">
                    <p class="content">
                From the beginning of time , after the fall of Man in the garden of Eden , God always used a ‚Äúman‚Äù ( human ) to reach the nation including individuals . Up to this day He still uses same.
                     Each one of us God uses as a messenger , you are a messenger for another person . Our leaders are Gods messengers to us, to bring us izimfihlakalo Zakhe . They are there to teach us . They need to teach us the order of doing things in the house of God and in our Christian lives,  because our God is a God of order. They teach us about the heart of God.
                        Our leaders can be defined as those people who stands in the gap between God and His people .  They pass messages both ways . God values us so much so that He brings a leader to help us .
                        Leaders are also the voice of God to the nation . This voice functions well and powerfully when brethren are fellowshiping together. There is power in fellowship especially if we submit to our leaders. Leaders evolve but we need to allow the change to happen so that the work of our leaders is blessed . When we obey the leaders and respect them , God‚Äôs anointing on us functions optimally. We must keep in mind that to be led is the right thing to happen . All the great leaders of the Bible were once led and mentored . Therefore  we must allow our leaders to guide , show , direct and rebuke us.
                        We should not forget to start with the family leaders in showing honour and respect , our parents . Jesus being a King , He respected His biological parents , though He was their God. He was setting an example to us. We are blessed when our parents speak a blessing upon our lives .
                         We were blessed from creation when God looked at everything He had created and said it is good, and gave humans dominion over everything . All we need now is a Man to release those blessings to us, and that man is your leader in the house of God and your  parents  or any other human who is directed by God to bless you . Remember we said we are all messengers that God can use to  deliver other people‚Äôs blessings .
                        If we respect our leaders and people in general especially those that we  have nothing  to gain by associating  and respecting them , we shall gain  both the favor of God and of the people .
                        In summary respect the leaders and be merciful to other people to receive God‚Äôs blessings .
                        SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY: 
                        Amos 3:7-9, 
                        Exodus 18:14-23, 
                        Genesis 1:26-31,
                        Proverbs 1:8-9,
                        Luke 2:41 & 52

                <div class="post">
                <p class="content">Today‚Äôs message was short, sweet, punchy and powerful!
                     When you meet with Jesus Christ , things change and shift around . You can never be the same after you have  had an  encounter with Him . The Samaritan woman met with Jesus and her life was never the same again . She left everything even the bucket she had brought with to fetch the water with . She ran to her village Evangelizing about ‚Äúthis man‚Äù who told her everything about her life . Of importance , she left the bucket so that she could move and run freely !
                        So even us today we must leave whatever is heavy !Shiya konke! Hlubula so you can move and run freely !  When you encounter Jesus , He doesn‚Äôt remind you  of the wrongs you have done , nor call you names , but He accepts you, and give you a new identity . You are called a child of God. He tells you to go in peace and  not to sin again .  When you let go,  and throw away everything that is heavy in your spirit Jesus changes you.
                        Brethren if you want to be safe with Jesus ; SHIYA! LET GO OF IT AND RUN ON YOUR SPIRITUAL JOURNEY 
                        SCRIPTURE FOR TODAY: 
                        John 4 : 13 - 18
                        Thanks grandma Mrs Esther Ntsane for this amazing massage ! May God continue to use you in evangelizing and winning the lost souls , and reviving the saved ones .</p>
